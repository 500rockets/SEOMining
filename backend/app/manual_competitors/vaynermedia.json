    "content": "VaynerMedia is an integrated strategy, creative and media agency. We put social at the center of everything we do. We're not just a creative agency or media agency - we're both in equal measures. Our services include integrated marketing, creative development, media planning, strategy consulting, and analytics. We combine full-funnel media and commerce expertise with fully integrated services including strategy, creative, analytics, and influencer marketing. We put human beings at the forefront of everything we do, ensuring our ideas and plans are culturally rich and consumer-led. We approach strategy with practicality, humility and empathy. We believe that brands today can't rely on a single, generic message served to a mass audience. The most effective way to drive relevance and growth is by speaking specifically and differently to people based on who they are, by listening and understanding. We're relentlessly focused on driving business results for brands. This means having a deep respect and intimate knowledge of channels where consumers are spending their time, and building modern planning, buying and analytics disciplines that drive consumers to act. We are a modern mix of traditional Madison Avenue thinkers and internet-centric storytellers who believe a social post can go all the way to a Super Bowl commercial.",
