"""
Scoring services for SEO Mining.

Provides 8+ scoring algorithms for semantic and structural analysis:
- Alignment: Semantic similarity to competitors
- Coverage: Topic cluster coverage
- Metadata: Title/meta/H1 alignment
- Hierarchy: H1→H2→H3 logical flow
- Thematic Unity: Content consistency
- Balance: Section length distribution
- Query Intent: Query type matching
- Composite: Weighted average of all scores
