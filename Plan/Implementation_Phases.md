## Quick Start Recommendations

**Start with Phase 1, Tasks 1-5**:
1. Set up the environment and storage
2. Get ValueSerp working with your API key
3. Implement proxy manager for your 50 proxies
4. Successfully fetch and save pages through proxies
5. Test end-to-end: keyword → SERP → scrape → store

This gives you immediate value and lets you verify the entire data collection pipeline before building analysis features.

**Then Phase 2, Tasks 1-4**:
6. Get embeddings working (start with OpenAI for speed)
7. Implement clustering (copy from Magic-SEO)
8. Calculate similarity scores
9. Implement structural coherence scoring

**Then Phase 2.5 (NEW - Critical)**:
10. Build analysis engine to interpret scores
11. Generate action plans automatically
12. This is where the magic happens - turning data into decisions!
