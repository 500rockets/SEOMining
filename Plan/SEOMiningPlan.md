# Semantic Relevance Optimization Plan

## Objective
Create a process to compare your page’s semantic relevance against the top 10 search results and iteratively improve your page’s content to achieve higher relevance scores.

## Steps

### 1. Collect Baseline Data
- **Identify Your Page:** Choose the page you want to optimize and note the target keyword.
- **Retrieve Top 10 Results:** Use a search engine or an SEO tool to get the top 10 URLs for your target keyword.

### 2. Spider and Extract Content
- **Crawl Each Competitor Page:** Use a web scraping tool to extract the main content from each of the top 10 pages.
- **Generate Embeddings:** For each competitor page, generate a semantic embedding (e.g., using a language model like BERT or a similar tool) to capture the semantic profile.

### 3. Compare and Analyze Embeddings
- **Baseline Your Page:** Generate the embedding for your own page’s current content.
- **Calculate Similarities:** Compare your page’s embedding to each of the top 10 embeddings to see where you stand in terms of semantic relevance.

### 4. Identify Optimization Opportunities
- **Extract Key Terms and Phrases:** Identify common phrases or themes that high-ranking pages use.
- **Build a Word Cloud:** Visualize frequently used terms to spot patterns.

### 5. Iterative Content Adjustment
- **Generate Candidate Phrases:** Use an AI or script to suggest new sentences or phrases that align with the patterns you found.
- **Recalculate Embeddings:** After adding or modifying content, regenerate the embedding and check if the relevance score improves.

### 6. Automate the Process
- **Scripting:** Write a script that loops through these steps: testing new phrases, recalculating embeddings, and identifying which changes lead to better scores.

### 7. Final Comparison and Deployment
- **Compare Final Scores:** Once you’ve reached a satisfactory improvement, do a final comparison against the top 10 to see how much you've gained.
- **Deploy Changes:** Update your live page with the optimized content.
