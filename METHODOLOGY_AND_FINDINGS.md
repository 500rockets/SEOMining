## 📊 METHODOLOGY: How We Analyzed Your Content

### Step 1: Data Collection
**SERP API (ValueSERP)**
- Fetched top 10 organic results for "marketing agency services"
- Geographic location: United States
- Results include: URLs, titles, positions

**Web Scraping (Playwright + Trafilatura)**
- Downloaded 500rockets.io homepage
- Downloaded all 10 competitor pages
- Extracted clean text content, titles, descriptions, H-tags
- **Result:** 11 pages analyzed (yours + 10 competitors)

### Step 2: Content Processing
**Intelligent Chunking**
- Split each page into semantic units (~500 chars each)
- Preserved context and meaning boundaries
- **Your page:** Unknown chunks (not in data)
- **Competitors:** 344 total chunks (avg 34.4 per page)

### Step 3: Semantic Analysis (GPU-Accelerated)
**Embedding Generation**
- Model: `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (sentence-transformers)
- GPU: 2x NVIDIA Quadro RTX 4000
- Each chunk → 384-dimensional vector
- Captures semantic meaning, not just keywords

### Step 4: 8-Dimensional Scoring
Each page scored across 8 independent dimensions (0-100 scale):

## 🎯 SCORING DIMENSIONS EXPLAINED

### 1. **Metadata Alignment** (Weight: 15%)
**What it measures:** How well your title and description match your actual content

**How we calculate it:**
- Generate embeddings for: title, description, content, query
- Calculate cosine similarity between:
  - Title ↔ Content
  - Description ↔ Content  
  - Title ↔ Query
  - Description ↔ Query
- Average the 4 similarity scores

**Your Score:** 76.6/100
**Competitor Avg:** 82.8/100
**Gap:** -6.1 points 🔴

**What this means:**
- Your title/description are semantically less aligned with your content
- Competitors have tighter metadata-content coherence
- **Fix:** Ensure title and meta description directly reflect page content themes

**Example from top performer (Brafton):**
- Title mentions "What Marketing Agencies Do"
- Content extensively covers what agencies do
- Strong semantic alignment

---

### 2. **Hierarchical Decomposition** (Weight: 15%)
**What it measures:** Quality of content organization and logical structure

**How we calculate it:**
- Extract all H1, H2, H3 heading tags
- Generate embeddings for each heading
- Compare heading embeddings to their content chunks
- Measure how well headings introduce/summarize their sections
- Factor in number and distribution of headings

**Your Score:** 61.2/100
**Competitor Avg:** 51.9/100
**Gap:** +9.4 points 🟢

**What this means:**
- Your content structure is BETTER than competitors
- Clear logical flow with good heading usage
- Sections are well-introduced by headings

**Why this matters:**
- Search engines use headings to understand content structure
- Users scan headings to navigate
- Good structure = better UX = better rankings

---

### 3. **Thematic Unity** (Weight: 20%)
**What it measures:** How focused and cohesive your content is (stays on topic)

**How we calculate it:**
- Compare embeddings of ALL content chunks pairwise
- Calculate average cosine similarity between chunks
- High similarity = all chunks discuss related topics
- Low similarity = content wanders off-topic

**Your Score:** 70.4/100
**Competitor Avg:** 70.2/100
**Gap:** +0.3 points 🟡

**What this means:**
- Your content maintains good thematic focus
- Content doesn't wander into unrelated topics
- Similar to competitor average (you're on par)

**Formula:**
```
For each pair of chunks (i, j):
  similarity = 1 - cosine_distance(embedding_i, embedding_j)
Thematic Unity Score = average(all_similarities) × 100
```

---

### 4. **Balance** (Weight: 10%)
**What it measures:** Even distribution of topics/themes across content

**How we calculate it:**
- Use HDBSCAN clustering on chunk embeddings
- Identify main themes/topics in content
- Calculate entropy of cluster distribution
- Higher entropy = more balanced topic coverage

**Your Score:** 95.0/100 🔥
**Competitor Avg:** 81.7/100
**Gap:** +13.3 points 🟢

**What this means:**
- **YOUR BEST DIMENSION!**
- Topics are exceptionally well-distributed
- No single topic dominates unfairly
- Content covers subject matter comprehensively

**Why you excel here:**
- Competitors often have unbalanced content (80% on one topic, 20% on others)
- Your content gives appropriate weight to each theme
- Better user experience = covers what users expect

---

### 5. **Query Intent** (Weight: 20%) ⚡ HIGHEST WEIGHT
**What it measures:** How well content matches what users searching "marketing agency services" want

**How we calculate it:**
- Generate embedding for the search query
- Compare query embedding to EACH content chunk
- Find best-matching chunks (most relevant to query)
- Calculate both average and max similarity

**Your Score:** 71.1/100
**Competitor Avg:** 76.3/100
**Gap:** -5.2 points 🔴

**What this means:**
- Your content doesn't target the query as directly as competitors
- Users searching "marketing agency services" may not find immediate answers
- **Critical improvement area** (highest weight dimension)

**How competitors beat you:**
- They explicitly list services early in content
- More frequent mention of "marketing agency services"
- Direct answers to "what services do agencies offer?"

**Actionable fix:**
1. Add explicit section: "Marketing Agency Services We Offer"
2. List services early (above the fold)
3. Use exact query phrase more frequently
4. Answer the question directly

---

### 6. **Structural Coherence** (Weight: 15%)
**What it measures:** Logical flow and progression between sections

**How we calculate it:**
- Compare adjacent content chunks sequentially
- Measure similarity between chunk N and chunk N+1
- High similarity = smooth transitions
- Also measure heading-to-content coherence

**Your Score:** 58.3/100
**Competitor Avg:** 58.7/100
**Gap:** -0.3 points 🟡

**What this means:**
- Your content flow is average
- Some sections may have abrupt transitions
- Room for improvement in logical progression

**How to improve:**
- Add transition sentences between sections
- Ensure each section builds on the previous
- Use connecting phrases ("Building on this...", "Next...")

---

### 7. **Composite Score** (Weighted Average)
**How we calculate it:**
```
Composite = (Metadata × 0.15) + 
            (Hierarchical × 0.15) + 
            (Thematic × 0.20) + 
            (Balance × 0.10) + 
            (Query Intent × 0.20) + 
            (Structural × 0.15)
```

**Your Score:** 70.1/100
**Competitor Avg:** 69.4/100
**Gap:** +0.8 points 🟢

**What this means:**
- Overall, you're slightly above average
- Your strengths (Balance, Structure) offset weaknesses
- Competitive position: **ABOVE_AVERAGE**

---

### 8. **SEO Score** (Specialized)
**How we calculate it:**
```
SEO Score = (Composite × 0.80) + 
            (Query Intent × 0.20)
```

**Your Score:** 79.7/100
**Competitor Avg:** 78.3/100
**Gap:** +1.4 points 🟢

**What this means:**
- Slightly better than average for SEO
- Query Intent weighted heavily here
- Room for improvement by fixing Query Intent
