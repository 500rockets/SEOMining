## 🚀 **What This Does:**

### **GPU Power Calculation:**
- **2x RTX 4000 GPUs** = 16GB VRAM total
- **Processing Speed:** ~2,000 embeddings/second per GPU
- **1 Hour Analysis:** ~14.4 MILLION phrase embeddings processed
- **Semantic Analysis:** Every phrase from every competitor analyzed
- **Output:** Complete optimized page content in markdown

### **The "Password Cracker" Approach:**
Instead of guessing what works, we:
1. **Extract EVERY phrase** from all competitors (thousands)
2. **Generate embeddings** for each phrase (GPU-accelerated)
3. **Compare semantic similarity** to your query
4. **Find optimal combinations** that top performers use
5. **Generate complete content** with exact phrases

## 📊 **Expected Output:**

### **Files Generated:**
1. **`optimized_500rockets_content.md`** - Complete page content ready to implement
2. **`intensive_generation_results.json`** - Full analysis data
3. **Semantic gap analysis** - Exact phrases missing from your content

### **Content Structure:**
- **Title:** Optimized for "marketing agency services"
- **Meta Description:** Includes all high-impact phrases
- **H1/H2 Structure:** Based on competitor analysis
- **Service Sections:** Exact phrases from top performers
- **Content Flow:** Optimized for semantic coherence
