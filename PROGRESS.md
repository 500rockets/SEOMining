## üìù Notes & Decisions

### Architecture Decisions
- **Separate repo from Magic-SEO**: Cleaner architecture, copy ~30% of code
- **GPU-first approach**: Local embeddings, $0 API costs
- **Dual GPU support**: Use both RTX 4000s for 2x speed
- **Hashing optimization**: 93%+ cache hit rate for fast iteration
- **No direct connections**: All scraping through proxy pool (when available)

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: FastAPI + Celery + PostgreSQL + Redis
- **ML**: sentence-transformers + HDBSCAN + scikit-learn
- **GPU**: PyTorch + CUDA 12.1
- **Container**: Docker + NVIDIA Container Toolkit
